The significand part of double value has 52 bits, which means it has effectively 53 bits precision. Assuming that the resolution of this timestamp is microsecond (e.g. gettimeofday() function returns the current time in microsecond resolution), and assuming the epoch is 1858-11-17 12:00:00 UT (MJD), a single double variable can count the time until year 2143 (=~ 1858 + 2^53 / 365 / 24 / 60 / 60 / 1000 / 1000) in microsecond resolution. After that, the time resolution will be worse. This is probably OK considering TMT lifetime, but the operation system normally reports the time as an integer value(s) anyway. TCS does not have to convert it to double which has less precision than 64-bit integer.*
