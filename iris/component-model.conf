description = """
The TCS provides telemetry streams to control several components of IRIS:

* **OIWFS probe arms**: The three arms are continuously positioned over guide stars.
* **4 ADCs**: One fore each OIWFS probe arm, and one for the imager.
* **rotator**: IRIS is rotated to compensate sidereal rotation and changes in pupil rotation, thus maintaining a stable scientific image.
* **rotating cold-stop**: rotating stage that masks the pupil inside the imager.
